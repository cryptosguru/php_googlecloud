# GrocerEase

In order to run this app, you'll need to test it locally with
Xampp by creating a local repository in your /htdocs directory
and pulling the files in.

In order to create a working database, export the SQL file from
Google Cloud Platform and import that into phpMyAdmin.

Upon pushing for the final production, the connectdb.php file
will need be changed to connect to the Google Cloud Platform database
(by commenting out the relevant database variables at the
top of the file).
